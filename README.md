## 🚀 What I'm Learning and Planning

I'm constantly improving, focusing on these areas to grow as a Full-Stack Engineer and Data Scientist:

- **Modern Web Development:** Deepening knowledge in TypeScript, Node.js and Next.js for Full-Stack development.
- **Security:** Learning about DevSecOps practices and tools.
- **Languages:** Strengthening my foundations in Java (at university).

## Highlights and Recognition

- Local Winner and Global Nominee of the NASA Space Apps Challenge with the project "AirMood".
- High academic performance at Univates (Impulsiona Scholarship holder).

Although I don't have many valuable projects published here on GitHub yet, that's mainly because I’m taking six courses at university while working ten hours a day, plus commuting. However, I intend to change that in the coming months.
